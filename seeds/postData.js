      content: `Before the advent of SPA, web applications were typically multi-page. This meant that every time a user interacted with the application,
       the server sent a new page in its entirety and a browser loaded it again. Each time the user navigated between pages, a complete page reload occurred,
        and it could slow things down and create a less-than-smooth user experience. Similar applications were often built using server-side technologies
         such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, etc., which generated HTML code on the server side and sent it to the browser.`,

      content: `Becoming a proficient backend developer requires mastering various skills and technologies within a relatively short timeframe.

      Below, I outline a comprehensive roadmap to help you achieve this goal in six months:
      
      Month 1: ü¶¥Foundations of Backend Development
      
      Week 1: Understand the role and responsibilities of a back-end developer. Familiarize yourself with databases, frameworks, and APIs.
      Week 2-3: Join a comprehensive course on databases. Learn about SQL and relational databases like MySQL. Practice creating and managing databases.
      Week 4: Learn about server-side programming languages. Start with PHP or Python. Learn basic syntax, control structures, and data types.
      Month 2: üçñAdvanced Backend Concepts
      
      Week 1-2: Deepen your understanding of databases. Explore NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Learn about data modeling and optimization.
      Week 3-4: Master server-side programming languages. Dig deeper into PHP or Python. Learn about functions, classes, and object-oriented programming.
      Last 2 days: Get hands-on projects with frameworks. Choose a popular framework like Laravel for PHP or Django for Python. Build simple applications to understand model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.
      Month 3: üå¶Ô∏èAPI Development and Integration
      
      Week 1-2: Learn about APIs and their importance in backend development. Explore RESTful API design principles.
      Week 3: Start building your own APIs. Use tools like Postman to test and debug API endpoints. Learn about authentication and security.
      Week 4: Focus on API integration. Learn how to consume APIs in web and mobile applications. Practice integrating third-party APIs into your projects.`,

      title: "How you can use ORMs better",
      content: `We love ORMs because they simplify and streamline the working process with relational databases.

      ORMs provide a higher level of abstraction, allowing us to work with objects and classes instead of raw SQL queries. They automate everyday database tasks such as CRUD operations, reducing the boilerplate code we need to write. ORMs handle database connections and transactions, making managing and scaling our applications easier. With ORMs, it's possible to write database-agnostic code, quickly switch between different database systems, and focus more on application logic.
      
      But with all the benefits and abstractions, it is easy to write poorly performant code.
      
      For the examples, I'll use the scheme from the Prisma ORM documentation, which describes a blogging platform with users, profile details, posts, and categories.`,

      title: "THIS(and why DEREK HATES it",
      content: `The 'this' keyword in javascript is a reference pointing to the parent element. If it is in the global context it will always point to the window.
      Lizard man Derek hates it because he finds it infuriatingly difficult to articulate any kind of explanation of the term and its function without using the 
      word, lending to a situation where 'it hurt itself in confusion'(he in fact did many times). Personally I think you could just use other similar words such as 
      'it', 'that', 'the thing over there' 'it-that-must-not-be-named', and other various increasingly silly euphamisms. But I digress. He is the master coder and I 
      am the grasshopper so I will end THIS article by saying death to THIS. `,
